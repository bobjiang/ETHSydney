## 🌏 ETHSydney 2024: **Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again** 🌏

We just wrapped up an unforgettable weekend at [#ETHSydney 2024](https://2024.ethsydney.net/), where builders, visionaries, and innovators came together at [UNSW Founders](https://unswfounders.com/) to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the Web3 space! The event brought together over 80 enthusiastic participants, 18 seasoned mentors, 5 sponsors, and 11 community supporters, all driven by the shared mission of “making Ethereum cypherpunk again.”

With three days of intense brainstorming, hacking, and collaboration, participants had the opportunity to bring their wildest ideas to life, and the results were beyond extraordinary. 💻✨
